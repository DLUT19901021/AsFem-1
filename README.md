# AsFem
**AsFem** is short for *a simple finite element method* program, for my own personal interests. I develop it via the [VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

# Requirement
- [cmake](https://cmake.org/)
- [gcc/g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/download/index.html)

For the installation of PETSc, and its simple applications for scientific computing, one is referred to my [PetscExercise](https://github.com/walkandthinker/PetscExercise).
- [openmpi](http://www.open-mpi.de/) or [mpich](https://www.mpich.org/)

The mpi library can be ignored for only sequential computing.
